# Budget-App
I've always had trouble budgeting my Income and Expenses. So I've created this simple budget app to keep track of my income and my expenses. The unique thing about my budget app is that each expense will show the percentage of that item to your total income. So you'll easily be able to see what your big spenders are as well as can help budget future puchases like car payments or rent to income.
